Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis

Jun.20, 2023 - Jun.22, 2023, 9 a.m. - 5:00 p.m daily.

Contact - UC Davis Bioinformatics Core, [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu)

This three-day online workshop covers experimental design, data generation, and analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data. Participants will explore a single cell experiment using the command line and R, create and modify workflows, and diagnose and treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. The primary packages used for analysis will be 10x software for sequence reads to counts, and the R package Seurat for downstream analysis.

To get the most out of this course, please complete the prerequisite material in [command line](base/cli_prerequisites) and [R](base/r_prerequisites) before the course, and contact us with any questions.

This workshop will be held online from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm each day.

Participants will need access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, a current versions of [R version](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple).
